### Working Principle
Temperature Sensor Interaction: The LM35 sensor measures the ambient temperature and provides an analog signal to the Arduino.
Data Conversion: The Arduino converts the sensor’s analog voltage output into temperature units (°C) and can optionally convert to Fahrenheit.
Display on LCD: The Arduino uses the LiquidCrystal_I2C library to display the temperature readings on a 16x2 LCD.
LED Indicators: The system includes visual indicators where LEDs light up based on predefined temperature thresholds.


### Results
The final product functions as a digital thermometer, continuously reading the temperature, converting it into a readable value, and displaying it on the LCD. The system offers a clear and easy way to monitor the surrounding temperature with visual LED indicators for temperature thresholds.


### Usage
Assemble the components as per the circuit diagram.
Power the Arduino via USB or external power supply.
The system will start monitoring the temperature and display it on the LCD.
