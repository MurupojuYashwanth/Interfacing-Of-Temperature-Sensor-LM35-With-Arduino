# Interfacing-Of-Temperature-Sensor-LM35-With-Arduino

### Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust temperature monitoring system using an Arduino Uno R3 and an LM35 temperature sensor. The system is designed to precisely measure and display temperature fluctuations in the surrounding environment on a 16x2 LCD. This foundational project has potential applications in climate regulation, industrial process monitoring, and other environmental control systems.
